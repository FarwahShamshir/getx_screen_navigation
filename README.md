Flutter GetX Navigation & Animation Demo
This is a basic Flutter project demonstrating how to navigate between three screens using GetX for navigation management, along with incorporating Lottie animations and meaningful quotes on each screen. The project includes:

Home Screen: Features a travel-related quote and a Lottie animation, with a button to navigate to Screen 2.
Screen 2: Displays a short-time-related quote with a Lottie animation. You can go back to Home or pass data to Screen 3.
Screen 3: Shows a programming-related quote with a Lottie animation. The button allows the user to navigate back to the Home Screen.
Features:
Simple navigation using GetX.
Named routes with argument passing between screens.
Integration of Lottie animations for a visually appealing user experience.
Background image with low opacity to enhance the visual design without overpowering content.
Inspirational quotes on travel, time, and programming displayed on each screen.
